# Pythics


Pythics is an application for running Python code intended to be used for simple interfaces to laboratory instrument or numerical simulations. It features a simple system for making graphical user interfaces (GUIs), useful controls including plotting, clean separation between GUI and application code, and multithreading and multiprocessing so running backend code does not interfere with the functionality of the GUI. Pythics attempts to robustly handle all of the complex details of writing a program with a GUI for you, allowing you to concentrate on the functionality of your program. Backend code is written in Python, while the GUI is specified in XHTML/CSS. This project is intended as an open source and more easily useable alternative to LabView.
